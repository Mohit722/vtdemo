# Maven Java Application: This repository contains a Maven-based Java web application designed to demonstrate best practices in building, deploying, and testing a web application.

# Features

- Maven Build: Easy build and packaging of the application as a WAR file.
- Deployment: Simple deployment to any compatible web server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty).
- Unit Testing: Configured with JaCoCo for code coverage reporting.

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Java JDK 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6.0 or higher

# Building the Application

To build the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Run the Maven clean install command:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

This command will compile the code, run tests, and package the application into a WAR file located in the `target` directory.


# Deploying the WAR File

After a successful build, you can deploy the generated WAR file to your web server:

- Copy the WAR file from the `target` directory to the appropriate deployment directory of your web server.


# Unit Testing

You can add unit tests to the application as follows:

1. Create test classes under the `src/test/java` directory.
2. The project is configured with the JaCoCo plugin in the `pom.xml` file for generating code coverage reports.

To run the tests and generate the coverage report, use:

```bash
mvn test
```

The test results and coverage reports will be available in the `target/site/jacoco` directory.

# Conclusion

Feel free to explore and enhance the application as needed. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
